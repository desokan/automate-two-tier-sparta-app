# Automate app deployment using an image and a bit of user data

## Create a VM using a custom image

- Start creating a new VM. In the `Image` field, click `See all images`.
- In the left sidebar, click `My images`. Select `cloudfun1-rasheed-ready-to-run-image`
- License type: `Other`
- In the `Advanced` section, add the script below to the `User data` field.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# update
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get update -y

# upgrade
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get upgrade -y

# install nginx
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install nginx -y

# create reverse proxy
echo creating reverse proxy...
sudo sed -i 's|try_files.*;|proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;|' /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
echo done creating reverse proxy! ...

# download node.js and install
echo downloading nodejs! ...
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x -o setup_nodejs.sh
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive bash setup_nodejs.sh
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install nodejs -y
echo done downloading nodejs! ...

# restart nginx
echo restart nginx ...
sudo systemctl restart nginx
echo done! ...

# enable nginx
echo enable nginx ...
sudo systemctl enable nginx
echo done!

# Clone the app repo
echo cloning app rep ...
git clone https://github.com/desokan/my-sparta-app.git
echo done cloning app rep!

# install pm2 globally
echo installing pm2 ...
sudo npm install -g pm2
echo done installing pm2!

# Create environment variable using the database ip address - 10.0.3.4
echo creating environment variable...
export DB_HOST=mongodb://10.0.3.4:27017/posts
echo done creating environment variable!

# make environment variable persist through restart
echo 'export DB_HOST=mongodb://10.0.3.4:27017/posts' >> ~/.bashrc

# Confirm environment variable was created
echo confirming environment...
printenv DB_HOST
echo done!
```
- When done, click Create

## Create a generalised image from the VM

- Open the VM created above
- Click the Capture button
- Share image to Azure compute gallery: Select `No, capture only a managed image`
- Name: `cloudfun1-rasheed-ready-to-run-app-image`
- Add tag and Create

## Test the Image

- Create a new VM using the `cloudfun1-rasheed-ready-to-run-app-image` image
- Use the following script in the `Custom data`

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Change directory
cd /my-sparta-app/app

# Install dependencies
echo installing dependencies...
npm install
echo done installing dependencies!

# start node.js app with pm2
echo starting nodejs...
pm2 start app.js --name "my-sparta-app"
echo done""
```

## Optional: How to Create Custom Images From Scratch

Marketplace image was used to create our app, installed all the dependencies on it for the app to run. From this, we can create a `custom image`. This new image can be used to create new virtual machine.

You will get an error saying you need to include `plan information`. This is saying that you need to give credit to the original image owner (Canonical). You can't do that if you use the portal. You can include the `Plan Information` through `Azure CLI`. You can include the information in the CLI command.

Alternatively, you can create an image by not including plan information. This will require you to go to the ubuntu website, download the VHD format, uncompress it, and then store it in the `Blob storage` in Azure.
